I created this Rust version just to see if I could. It works, but I have made updates to the Python version that I have not made here. The output of the Rust version is identical to the output of the first working Python version. But the Python version should be more correct. However, making the Rust version was only a matter of one prompt in the Cursor editor, and fixing the Python version was only a matter of one prompt to the Warp terminal. So, if you want a better Rust version, you won't have to do much.
